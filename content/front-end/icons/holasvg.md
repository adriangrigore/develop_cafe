Summary: Free Open SVG Icons Illustration, DIY SVG icons: build your own set with basic shapes. ​​There are different ways to work with icons, but the best solution always includes SVG, either inline or linked up as a file. Sometimes the icons we download (or the ones we create with a drawing software) have a lot of unnecessary code that if we use it inline makes our document longer to scroll, uncomfortable to work with, and just a little bit heavier.
