Summary: IconPark gives access to more than 1,400 high-quality icons, and introduces an interface for customizing your icons. Instead of using various SVG source files to achieve different themes, We implement a technology transforming attributes of a single SVG source file into multiple themes. Besides, we provide cross-platform components, including react-icons, vue-icons and svg-icons. So whether you are a designer or a developer, you can use them in your designs or your projects for free.
