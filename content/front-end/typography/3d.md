Summary: Easy to implement, 3D typography for any website and any font. Ztext gives the illusion of volume by creating layers from an HTML element. There's no need to spend hours fiddling with <canvas> or forcing users to download multi-megabyte WebGL libraries. Content remains fully selectable and accessible.
