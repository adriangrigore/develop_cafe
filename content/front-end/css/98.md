Summary: A design system for building faithful recreations of old UIs. This library relies on the usage of semantic HTML. To make a button, you'll need to use a <button>. Input elements require labels. Icon buttons rely on aria-label. This page will guide you through that process, but accessibility is a primary goal of this project.
