Summary: How to modify Develop Cafe
Github_edit_link: https://github.com/melboone/develop_cafe/edit/master/content/pages/how-to.md

Get started with a [sample file](/theme/extra/page_template.md).

## Format

Every page and article on this website uses Markdown format with `.md` extension. 
Markdown cheat sheet can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

## Mandatory Elements

Every page, at a minimum, must have the following:

    Title: My super title
    Date: 2010-12-03 10:20
    Slug: category/my-super-title

As you can see the `Slug:` contains the category before the actual slug. This helps 
better categorizing the URLs and avoid confusion.

For general pages, such as this one or [`About`](pages/about.html), category is 
always `pages/`.

A good starting point is the `template_` file created in each category.

## Optional Fields

| **Property** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Creating a new page

Create a `.md` file in the appropriate folder (or new one), add the above elements. 
It is a good idea to add the file to 
the [configuration](https://github.com/melboone/develop_cafe/blob/master/pelicanconf.py) 
file as well, in the `MENUITEMS`.

A good starting point is the `template_` file created in each category.

## Private comments

If you want to comment in page but you don't want to show it to the end user, use
`[//]: # (This comment will not be visible to the end user)`
