## Format

Every page and article on this website uses Markdown format with `.md` extension. Markdown basics can be found [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).

## Mandatory Elements

Every page, at a minimum, must have the following:

    Title: My super title
    Date: 2010-12-03 10:20
    Slug: category/my-super-title

    Content

As you can see the `Slug:` contains the category before the actual slug. This helps better categorizing the URLs and avoid confusion.

For general pages, such as this one or [`About`](pages/about.html), category is always `pages/`.

## Optional Fields

| **Property** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Creating a new page

To create a new page, create a `.md` file in the appropriate folder (or new one), add the above elements. It is a good idea to add the file to the [configuration](https://github.com/melboone/develop_cafe/blob/master/pelicanconf.py) file as well, in the `MENUITEMS`.
