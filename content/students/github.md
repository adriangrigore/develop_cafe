## GitHub Student Developer Pack

[Github Link](https://education.github.com/pack?sort=popularity)

Learn to ship software like a pro. There's no substitute for hands-on experience.
But for most students, real world tools can be cost-prohibitive.
That's why we created the GitHub Student Developer Pack with some of our partners and
friends: to give students free access to the best developer tools in one place so they
can learn by doing.
